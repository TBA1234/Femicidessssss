          Intimate femicide:  
        </h2>
        <p>Femicide committed by a current or former husband or boyfriend
          Preliminary findings of an ongoing study by WHO and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine show that more than 35% of all murders of women globally are reported to be 2 committed by an intimate partner.

        <h2>Murders in the name of ‘honour’:</h2>
        <p>Honour’-related murders involve a girl or woman being killed by a male or female family member for an actual or assumed sexual or behavioural transgression, including adultery, sexual intercourse or pregnancy outside marriage – or even for being raped. Often the perpetrators see this femicide as a way to protect family reputation, to follow tradition or to adhere to wrongly interpreted religious demands.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Definition</h2>
        <p class="lead">Violence against women has been recognised as an increasing problem in today’s society: it is a violation of human rights, a social problem, a public health problem and a barrier to economic development for countries.
          Femicide is the most extreme expression of VAW, the “killing of women by men motivated by hate, contempt, pleasure or the assumption of ownership of women”
          
          Because of the high femicide rates and as a response to internal and external pressure, Latin American countries started to take action against violence and discrimination against women in the second half of the 1990s.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Causes </h2>
        <p class="lead">Research is starting to help clarify the factors that increase women’s risk of being killed, especially by intimate partners, and those associated with an increased risk that men will perpetrate femicide. 
          The most widely used model for understanding any form of violence is the ecological model, which proposes that violence is influenced by factors operating at four levels: individual, family/relationship, community, and societal or structural (which relates to laws, policies and wider societal influences).

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Consequences. </h2>
        <p class="lead">When women are routinely harassed, assaulted and murdered they an internalize a sense of fear. Due to the deaths that happen every day women feel insecure and they don't want to go outside. They avoid going out to certain places or at a certain time. Despite the gravity of femicide and its impact on development, gender-based violence tends to remain invisible in strategies to boost economic growth. While the true cost of this violence remains unknown, violence against women does create a range of economic and development costs either direct or indirectly. (Global Citizen, 2015) </p>
